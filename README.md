# My Contacts

### Project made on [JStack](https://jstack.com.br/) course with [Mateus Silva](https://www.instagram.com/imateus.silva/?hl=en)

In this project, we made the entire API for the contacts using Node, Docker and Postgres with the basics CRUD operations, we also connected the API to the Front-end using React with a beautiful interface, loader animations, components with high level of abstraction, styled components, typed props and following a Figma layout created by Mateus itself.

### Techs & Tools (Front-end):
- React
- Styled Components
- Prop Types
- ESLint

### Techs & Tools (API)
- Node.js
- Docker
- Postgres
